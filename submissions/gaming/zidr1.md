# zkVerified Gaming Leaderboard

## Overview
A decentralized gaming leaderboard that uses the Soundness Layer to ensure fair play by validating player scores with zero-knowledge proofs (zkProofs).  
This ensures that all scores submitted are genuine, verifiable, and cannot be manipulated, while preserving the privacy of player data.

## Problem Statement
Traditional leaderboards are vulnerable to manipulation (e.g., bots, hacked clients, or falsified score submissions).  
Players and communities need a trustless way to validate scores without central authority or exposing sensitive gameplay data.

## Proposed Solution
- Integrate Soundness Layer as a verification engine.
- Players generate a zkProof of their score completion when submitting results.
- The leaderboard only accepts scores accompanied by valid zkProofs.
- Privacy is preserved: proof shows validity without revealing raw game data.

## Technical Architecture
- **Game Client (frontend)**: Provides score data and generates zkProof of completion.
- **Proof Generator (backend or local)**: Uses Soundness SDK to create zkProofs.
- **Verifier (on-chain)**: Smart contract integrated with Soundness Layer verifies proofs before updating the leaderboard.
- **Leaderboard dApp (frontend)**: Displays only verified scores.

## Development Timeline
- **Week 1**: Define game mechanics + minimal scoring system.
- **Week 2**: Implement zkProof generation using Soundness SDK.
- **Week 3**: Build smart contract verifier + leaderboard UI.
- **Week 4**: Deploy prototype to testnet and collect feedback.
